# ChallengeSmartsite

In this project, I created a page with the main objective of searching for units that offers a fluid and intuitive experience for users, maintaining consistency with the layout proposed in Material Design. The challenge was offered by <a href="https://github.com/bioritmo/front-end-code-challenge-smartsite/tree/master">Front-end Smart Fit </a>.


<b>Features include:</b>

<b>Unit Search:</b> Implementation of a search system that allows users to find Smart Fit units based on different criteria, opening hours, services offered, among others.

<b>Indication of Open/Closed Units:</b> Clearly highlight which units are open and which are closed, providing up-to-date and accurate information for users.

<b>Unit Details:</b> View full details for each unit, including address, opening hours, available services, plus any additional relevant information.

<b>Responsive Compatibility:</b> Ensure the page is fully responsive and compatible with a variety of devices, from desktops to smartphones, for a consistent user experience across all platforms.
